## Dancing Links (⋆⋆⋆⋆)

The exact cover problem takes a matrix of 0s and 1s as an input. Its solution is a set of rows that selects exactly one 1 in each column. This project implements Donald Knuth’s solution to the problem using Dancing Links, where:

- The matrix to be passed as an input is a two-dimensional array.
- The program constructs an internal, working version of the matrix as a grid of linked lists.
- A backtracking, recursive algorithm operates on the matrix, removing and restoring columns and rows, until an empty matrix is obtained.

### How It Works:

1. **Data Structure:**
   - Each element in the matrix is represented as a node in a doubly linked list. Each node has pointers to its left, right, up, and down neighbors. This structure allows for efficient removal and restoration of rows and columns during the search process.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The matrix is transformed into a toroidal linked list, where each node is connected to its neighbors, and columns are linked to form a circular structure.

3. **Covering Columns:**
   - When a column is covered, it is removed from the header, and all rows containing a 1 in that column are also removed. This ensures that no other rows in the solution can use that column.

4. **Uncovering Columns:**
   - When backtracking, columns are uncovered to restore the matrix to its previous state. This allows the algorithm to explore other potential solutions.

5. **Search Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm selects the column with the fewest 1s to optimize the search process. It recursively covers columns and rows, and backtracks when necessary, until it finds a solution or determines that no solution exists.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]

dlx = DLX(matrix)
dlx.search(0)
```

### Output:

```
Solution (internal column nodes):
[<__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fb20>, <__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fc10>]
[<__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fb50>, <__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fbe0>, <__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fb80>]
[<__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fbb0>, <__main__.DLXNode object at 0x102e2fd30>]
Solution (row indices):
[5, 3, 1]
```

## Edit Distance

The table represents the minimum cost of transforming the prefix of `x` (up to length `i`) into the prefix of `y` (up to length `j`). Each cell `T[i][j]` is computed as:

\[ T[i][j] = \min \begin{cases}
T[i-1][j-1] + \text{Sub}(x[i-1], y[j-1]) \\
T[i-1][j] + \text{Del}(x[i-1]) \\
T[i][j-1] + \text{Ins}(y[j-1]) \\
\end{cases} \]

Let's break down the table:

```
   ""  A  T  G  C  T  A
"" [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 A [1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 C [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
 G [3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 A [4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```

### Explanation of Table Calculation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The first row and the first column are initialized based on the costs of inserting or deleting characters to transform an empty string to the prefixes of `x` and `y`.

2. **Table Filling:**
   - For `i=1`, `j=1`: `x[0]='A'`, `y[0]='A'`, so no substitution needed (`T[1][1] = T[0][0] = 0`).
   - For `i=1`, `j=2`: `x[0]='A'`, `y[1]='T'`, substitution (`T[1][2] = T[0][1] + 1 = 1`).
   - Continue filling the table similarly for other `i` and `j` values.

### Optimal Alignment:

The optimal alignment is reconstructed by tracing back from `T[m][n]` to `T[0][0]` based on the costs. The optimal alignment found is:

```
('A', 'A')
('-', 'T')
('-', 'G')
('C', 'C')
('G', 'T')
('A', 'A')
```

### Verification of Optimal Alignment:

1. Start with both strings: `ACGA` and `ATGCTA`.
2. Align `A` with `A` (no cost, `Sub(A, A) = 0`).
3. Insert `T` (cost = 1, `Ins(T) = 1`).
4. Insert `G` (cost = 1, `Ins(G) = 1`).
5. Align `C` with `C` (no cost, `Sub(C, C) = 0`).
6. Align `G` with `T` (cost = 1, `Sub(G, T) = 1`).
7. Align `A` with `A` (no cost, `Sub(A, A) = 0`).

Total cost: \(0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\).

Therefore, the output matches the expected results for the edit distance algorithm with the given inputs and default costs. The edit distance is 3, and the alignment correctly reflects the operations needed to transform "ACGA" into "ATGCTA".
